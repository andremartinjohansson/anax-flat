Ah, my trusty MSI laptop, how I have abused you over the years. This is what I
spend most of my time on. To code, photoshop, watch series and even game sometimes.
It has been great but it's getting a little bit worn. For example, the F10 key came
off (don't even ask how or why) and I've been unable to put it back on. And actually,
it has blue screened a couple times now. Unsure why. Probably because I'm always pushing
it to the max. Actually I'm shocked that it still runs as well as it does. I remember
doing a lot of research before purchasing this laptop, to get the most out of my
money. And boy, I did. Picture taken with my OnePlus One with no particular settings.

Some different effects...

Bottom line, it's amazing. What a trooper!
