Enjoying BTH
==================================

Been going here to BTH in Karlskrona for a few months now. Great school and what
an amazing city. I come from "the country", Skåne, but I'm really loving Blekinge. Many trees, lakes and amazing views. And BTH is wonderfully located - the whole university is just
really great. Love it here! Took this photo outside the university with my OnePlus One,
just regular settings and hashtagnofilter.

But let's try using some filters.

Pretty cool stuff! Let's try some more stuff...
