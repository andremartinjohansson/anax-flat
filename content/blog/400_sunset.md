Sunset shopping
==================================

Yes, the Christmas shopping has started. Actually for me it's almost finished.
Only one more to go! But for most it hasn't even started. Nevertheless, I went out
shopping, rather than ordering from home. And wow, the amount of people. Everywhere.
It's why I prefer to order online - don't want to deal with the craziness. But,
clothes are a bit tricky to buy online I think, and I needed a second opinion. It
wasn't so bad, and on the way home I took this picture with my OnePlus One. Great sunset.

Some different effects...

But this is my favorite. Adjusted brightness and contrast, added sharpen and a little
more red and tiny bit of green. Looks pretty good!

I do love this CImage thing. It's like having Photoshop right in your code!
