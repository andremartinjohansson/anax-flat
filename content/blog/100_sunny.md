It's sunny
==================================

It's sunny and nice weather, despite it being late November. Sure, it's nice but
the sun is really low and blinding while driving. At least those trusty aviators
helped quite a bit. Took the photo in my car, a little Skoda hatchback, at the
university parking lot before heading in. Used my old OnePlus One phone with
a grayscale filter because why not.

What if we try to colorize it though?

Green works okay. Yellow less so. Maybe we can just try to improve the quality
of the image through some old PSD tricks?

I actually think that's okay! Weeee!

But, the most important question is... What would it look like if someone tried to draw me? Well...

Not perfect but not bad!
